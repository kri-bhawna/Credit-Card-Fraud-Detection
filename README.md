# Data Projects

Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection 
• Implemented a logistic regression model to identify credit card transactions as genuine or fraud, leveraging machine-learning techniques
• Trained the model utilizing a comprehensive dataset of 37,721 records, and achieved an accuracy of 92.63% against unseen test data set
• Evaluated feature importance for the trained model and conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning to optimize its performance

Project Title: Social Media Sentiment Analysis 
• Designed a predictive model using a dataset of 1.6 million tweets to ascertain TV show preferences through advanced NLP techniques
• Pre-processed the Tweets using the NLTK library and designed a function to identify emoticons and convert them to textual expressions
• Transformed the textual dataset into a TF-IDF feature matrix and employed logistic regression to train the predictive model

Project Title: Computer Vision based dynamic face mask detection system
• Devised a real-time Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for swift and accurate assessment of face mask presence on individuals
• Employed OpenCV to streamline the image processing from live webcam video frames, to ensure a seamless real-time operation
• Trained the model with a dataset consisting of 1376 images, performing hyperparameter tuning to achieve 96.38 %prediction accuracy
